  # ===========================================================================
  # ADD YOUR SCENARIOS BELOW
  # ===========================================================================

  # Scenario 1: [Replace with your scenario]
  # - name: "Your Scenario Name"
  #   goal: "What you want to build"
  #   requirements:
  #     - "Requirement 1"
  #     - "Requirement 2"
  #   task_type: "CODE_INTERPRET"
  #   category: "micro_saas"

  # Scenario 2: [Your next scenario]
  # ...

  # You can add 50-100 scenarios for comprehensive training
  # Focus on:
  #   - Micro/Nano SaaS products
  #   - Automation workflows
  #   - AI agents and tools
  #   - API integrations
  #   - Data processing services

# ===========================================================================
# Training Tips
# ===========================================================================
#
# 1. VARIETY: Include different types of tasks to build diverse skills
# 2. PATTERNS: Group similar tasks together (e.g., 5-10 validation APIs)
#    so ACE learns patterns that apply across them
# 3. PROGRESSION: Start simple, increase complexity gradually
# 4. REALISM: Use scenarios you'd actually build for production
# 5. SPECIFICITY: More detailed requirements = better training
#
# Recommended Mix:
#   - 40% Micro/Nano SaaS APIs
#   - 30% Automation workflows
#   - 20% AI agents and tools
#   - 10% Data processing/integrations
#
# Expected Results:
#   - 50 scenarios: ~15-20 skills learned
#   - 100 scenarios: ~30-40 skills learned
#   - Performance improvement: 20-35%
#   - Token reduction: 40-50%
